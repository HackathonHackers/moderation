        "message": "What a shit article.\nFirst you start by enumerating your failures and calling out people involved *by name* (which, by the way, is a great first impression of your probably objectionable personality), then after many paragraphs of one-sided stories, shift without the clutch into a generic and Silicon-Valley-worthy (the satirical TV show, not the actual demographic of hard-working entrepreneurs) startup pitch full of words that have grown to mean nothing. Why do you think this venture will end any better than your previous ones? Why are we to believe that this endeavor won't end in you speaking poorly of it once you latch onto a new idea in a few months, just like the previous ones you've so openly discussed? Why does the word \"money\" occur 14 times in your article and the word \"passion\" occur only once?\nBecause you represent exactly what is wrong with (and harmful to) the tech industry. Create and innovate for the purpose of self-fulfillment and/or benefiting the progression of the human race and not for the number of zeroes in your bank account, or get out of the way and let the real creators and innovators do their thing.",

When you're an employee of a startup, money matters because you're putting in twice as many hours as employees who work 9-5s. It's only until it's your startup are you willing to give up everything to solve a problem you're passionate about. So much truth in the article. I'll also vouch for the fact that some founders are so \"passionate\" about their idea that they\"ll justify out-of-character behavior to stay afloat.",

        "message": "Matt Mokary Honestly, cheers man for the honest comment! I feel as though my life is getting brutal feedback, adjusting, and bettering myself from there.\n\nI've been doing this company for 12 months now, with solid momentum. I absolutely fucking love it, the industry, and the goal behind it.\n\nThis post was very blunt, because it's how I feel it should be. I'd love to mention passion a ton of times, but that's really what's wrong with the tech industry, too many people talking shit about \"making the world a better place\".\n\nI will indeed be making the lives of my customers significantly better through out product. So that is what I will do, and what I will focus on. Not talking b.s. around it.\n\nIf it came off as if I am in this for money—you either misread it—or I failed to articulate it properly. I got into this because I had been taking Nootropics for over two years, and really feel passionate about letting the world know about them.\n\nI mentioned time and time again, after 4 years, I've not made a cent and still love doing it. I want to make that clear :-)\n\nIvan Teong Hrishi Olickel Thanks for your comments too guys. However, I'm going to have to completely disagree with you both here.\n\nSure, if I wanted to be an employee my whole life, this would be a bad move. But I am a founder, and it's what I will always strive toward being.\n\nStaying quiet, and not exposing these kinds of people makes you weak, and it's in no way commendable. It's cowardly.\n\nBecause think of how many more lives they're going to affect negatively if they continue? I don't want others to have to go through what I did.\n\nJulian Assange, Edward Snowden and Aaron Swartz all gave themselves a \"bad name\" to many. To others, they are heroes, because they did the right thing, and pointed out the corruption that is occurring.\n\nIt's a necessary evil—having to expose people by name—for the greater good. I 1,000% stand behind it, as I believe in transparency, doing the right thing by others, and not encouraging greed and corruption.\n\nIf you think I am wrong by doing that, then you're free to :-)",

            "message": "Sure the private conversation thing is a catch-22, of course I'll admit that's a moral dilemma. Like Snowden being prosecuted for exposing illegal activities from the NSA. Sure, it's illegal for him to publicly share classified documents, but it's also illegal for the company in question to be doing those sorts of activities.\n\nIMO, if you break *technicalities* in order to serve a greater good, you're providing a lot more value to others than you otherwise would have. If I did not do this, I'd be the only one  walking away with lessons-learned. \n\nWhat if I could prevent tens, or hundreds of people from wasting time they can't get back, by avoiding these people in the first place? That's significantly more valuable. The regard you're presenting it in is selfish.\n\nIn these two examples anyway. This OFC does not apply to every situation.\n\nSo to be very clear, forget about b.s. technicalities. Stop basing your argument on a fallacy / technicality, because when you REALLY get down to it (in this case, let's just stick to), it's more morally correct to expose these harmful people  (while immorally showing private messages), than it is to leave it be.\n\nThat's how I see it anyway. You cannot be 100% correct. But, you can most certainly be MORE correct by making one decision over the other.",

Now I understand you might be frustrated, every entrepreneur go through their own tough times and other bullsh*t. Like someone already commented, it is best to learn your lesson, and move on. Failing a few times is not a sin if you manage to get back, try hard till you succeed. You should expect to deal and meet all kind of people. This is not a perfect world. The fact that you copy private conversations with names and stuff on an article with no clear point prove that you are not ready for the business world. You may be a great programmer, but not business savvy at all. Take it from someone with a degree in international business, heavy training courses in Entrepreneurship, management etc. before I became a Computer Science related major. This speaks poorly of your personality, management skill and ability to work with people. I would not work with you either. If you are wise, and just realize you were either very angry or under the influence when you wrote that crap, swallow your pride and delete it. You will thank me later. This is my one (1) comment. I won’t make this an endless senseless conversation. I got other important things to do. Happy Holidays!",

You must not have properly read a significant amount of the post—because if you did—a lot of what you mentioned would not have been written (as it's not applicable).\n\nThere's been 100s of other failures I've experienced over the last 4 years. In both 2013 and 2014 I posted reviews (you can see them on my Medium). They did not call anyone out, and they were purely reflections.\n\nI don't know what your definition of \"ready\" is, but I've been in this game, and played significant roles for 4 years now. It's not a fact of being \"ready\", it's a fact of stepping the fuck up, failing, trying again, failing, trying again, and persisting** on until something good comes out of it. You're making a lot of assumptions.\n\nThis time it's different, because these are not just failures in and of themselves. They're bigger. They're working with others in the space who have extremely bad intentions. I disagree with being a cowardly bystander and letting them go unnoticed. I want people to see them for who they really are, so that they can avoid them to begin with.\n\nIt's not about pride. It's about doing what is right, and calling people out when necessary. If I were treating everyone at our company poorly, I WANT people to call me out on it, so that I can adjust my attitude, improve how I treat others, and do a better job in general.\n\nNo hate by the way—your feedback is really welcomed—as getting a range of perspectives from people helps me to learn, so thanks for taking the time to do so :-)",

If you REALLY think I cannot take constructive criticise, please point out exactly how I can't take it, and I'll change my approach here. As I don't want to be that guy, truly.\n\nIt's inappropriate to some, not others. Just a question (not an attack :-) ) have you personally gone through this experience, or founded a company of your own?\n\nI respect people when I am respected, and if you jump on my Facebook page and see the comments from colleagues (all of whom I have a professional relationship with), you'll see that I am fine in that regard.\n\nAnyway, keen to hear your thoughts man!
