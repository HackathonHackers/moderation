On a regular basis our teams interact with [x], life-sciences, ventures, and other alphabet companies.\n\nThe team tries to solve the following question: What business technology need is currently going unsolved, that can be built today, where google has a distinct advantage.\n\nOnce we identify a product which meets that criteria, we'll evaluate and potentially create an MVP and raise a seed fund (from google). If the project's successful we'll keep going through funding rounds and raising money internally.\n\nAs a prototype engineer, you'll get to write software for custom circuit-boards & hardware, embedded computing, cloud computing, big data, mobile apps, and web-apps.\n\nWe're looking for candidates with a strong software background, and an understating of product.
