To compensate for what this meant for your upcoming role, we paid you a cash stipend to thank you for the few weeks of part-time trial period work you did with us. I think it is a bit unreasonable that you are holding a grudge 2 years since we last were in touch. Frankly I think that's quite generous for early startup days. You also have some facts wrong in your post but I think it's time you move on. This ex-co-founder of ours has left the company since March 2014. Not sure why the grudge still against the company, as we've worked very hard to get to where we are now with steady revenues and a great team. All the best Kaustav I think you need to have better things to do with your time than discredit hard working founders who have put their souls into their companies.",
